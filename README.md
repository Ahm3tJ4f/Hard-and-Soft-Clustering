To find the optimal number of clusters in fuzzy clustering or soft clustering, I used Fuzzy Partition Coefficient or FPM. The FPC is defined on the range from 0 to 1, with 1 being best. In particularly, it calculates the all membership degrees of each point in dataset, and shows use the “diffusion degree” of dataset. It is a metric which tells us how cleanly our data is distributed by a certain model.

After fitting the model, result shows that the 3 cluster will be the most optimal number of centers for our dataset.
